In this implementation, we make the assumption that, for each time we input a term while performing multiple values searching, 
we shouldn't press the key "backspace", to delete the typed-in characters, too much (number of presses should be less than or 
equal to the number of characters we typed in). This is just to make sure the page won't crash (doesn't respond), not affecting 
any of the requirements.
